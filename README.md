### easy_access

This repository contains code for a project of the Brown University Library to make getting books and articles easier.

It contains code for the landing pages users see when they click links for books or articles which contain an [OpenUrl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenURL).

It also contains code for the handling of article-delivery (easyArticle); for books it hands off to an [easyBorrow](https://github.com/birkin/easyborrow_controller) project.


##### Acknowledgements:

Not shown in the commit history is the fact that this entire project was implemented by [Ted Lawless](https://github.com/lawlesst) from 2012 through 2015. It has made the work of thousands of Brown University students and faculty vastly easier.
