### easy_access

This repository contains code for a project of the Brown University Library to make getting books and articles easier.

It contains code for the landing pages users see when they click links for books or articles.

It also contains code for the handling of article-delivery (easyArticle); for books it hands off to an easyBorrow project.


##### Notes

- This code is not yet in production; it is based on work which is in production.

- The main purpose of this code is to merge together two separate projects.
